A visual algorithm complexity simulator that demonstrates different runtime behaviors (O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(nÂ²)) through racers moving around a track at speeds corresponding to their time complexity. The program reads track coordinates from files, constructs raceways on 2D character arrays, and animates racers moving clockwise around the track. Each racer prints its position at different intervals based on its algorithmic behavior, providing an interactive way to visualize how different Big-O complexities affect performance in practice.
